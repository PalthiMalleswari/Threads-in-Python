# 🚀 Threading Performance Practice

I'm exploring how Python threads can speed up tasks that involve network delays—like making API calls or downloading data.

As part of this practice, I ran a small comparison between:

- **🟦 Sequential execution**
- **🟩 Threaded execution**

### ✅ Key Observation
Threaded execution completed the same work in **about half the time**, showing a **2x performance boost** for network-bound tasks.

This helped me understand how threads can make programs more responsive and efficient when waiting on slow external operations.
